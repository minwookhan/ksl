I will provide a set of source files from a C++ gRPC client project.

## Tasks:
1. Summarize the responsibility of each file (1–3 sentences each).
2. Identify the program entry points (WinMain, dialogs, threads).
3. Explain the high-level architecture:
   - UI layer
   - gRPC communication layer
   - Video/preprocessing layer
   - ACR / AI module integration
4. Provide a step-by-step high-level dataflow:
   - User action → internal logic → gRPC request → server response → UI update

### Output Format:
- Section 1: File overview
- Section 2: Entry points
- Section 3: Architecture summary
- Section 4: Dataflow diagram

I will paste code files now. Reply “OK” after each until I say DONE.
